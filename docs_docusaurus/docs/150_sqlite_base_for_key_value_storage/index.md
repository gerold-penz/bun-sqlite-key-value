# SQLite as base for a key value storage

SQLite provides a solid and well-tested foundation.
SQLite reliably takes care of saving and reading data - 
both for short strings and for larger BLOBs. 
It provides a robust foundation on which to build.
Even if SQLite is not fully utilized and no relations between tables are required,
this is not a disadvantage.
